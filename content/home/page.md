Text: 

If you’re seeing this page, the installation of PRONTO worked. Now just give the links in the menu a try to see if URL redirection works as well. After that, you’re ready to go.

These pages are just some placeholders demonstrating the basic things of PRONTO, so you can easily get started and create awesome sites with PRONTO. You should find everything you need in the documentation at [http://prontocms.com/docs](http://prontocms.com/docs). If you run into any problems, feel free to contact us any time by droping us an email to [hello@prontocms.com](mailto:hello@prontocms.com).
